1. Messages
● Explanation: Messages are the core of the API’s conversation system. You use them to
set up the context and flow of the dialogue.
Example:
json
Copy code
[
{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;You are an expert travel advisor.&quot;},
{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Can you suggest some places to visit in Italy?&quot;}
]

○ The system message defines the assistant&#39;s role.
○ The user message contains the user&#39;s query.
○ The assistant will generate a response like:
&quot;Sure! In Italy, you can visit Rome, Venice, Florence, and the Amalfi Coast.&quot;

2. Model
● Explanation: Determines the specific AI model used for responses. Different models
vary in capabilities.
● Example:
○ Using gpt-3.5-turbo:
Response: &quot;Italy is a beautiful country! Rome and Venice are must-visits.&quot;
○ Using gpt-4:
Response: &quot;Italy offers a diverse experience with its rich history in Rome, artistic
masterpieces in Florence, the canals of Venice, and the stunning Amalfi Coast.&quot;
○ Key Difference: GPT-4 is more detailed and nuanced.

3. Max Completion Tokens
● Explanation: Limits the length of the assistant’s response in tokens.
● Example:
○ Setting max_tokens to 50:

&quot;Rome offers historical landmarks like the Colosseum and the Vatican. Venice...&quot;
○ Setting max_tokens to 150:
&quot;Rome offers historical landmarks like the Colosseum and the Vatican. Venice is
renowned for its canals and gondolas. Florence is the hub of Renaissance art
and architecture. The Amalfi Coast provides breathtaking coastal scenery, ideal
for relaxation.&quot;

4. n
● Explanation: Specifies how many response variations the model should generate.
Example:
json
Copy code
{
&quot;n&quot;: 3
}
●
○ Output:
1. &quot;Rome is a must-visit city in Italy.&quot;
2. &quot;Italy has amazing places like Venice and Florence.&quot;
3. &quot;Explore Rome, Florence, and the Amalfi Coast for an unforgettable trip.&quot;
○ Use Case: Compare responses to choose the best one.

5. Stream

it feel faster for users.
● Example:
○ Output with stream = true:
&quot;Rome is a...&quot;
&quot;...beautiful city with...&quot;
&quot;...many historical sites.&quot;

6. Temperature

● Example:

○ Temperature 0.2 (focused, factual):
&quot;Rome, Venice, Florence, and the Amalfi Coast are top destinations in Italy.&quot;
○ Temperature 0.8 (creative, varied):
&quot;If you&#39;re visiting Italy, don&#39;t miss the eternal charm of Rome, the romantic canals
of Venice, and the picturesque Amalfi Coast sunsets.&quot;

7. Top_p
● Explanation: Limits responses to the most probable outcomes.
● Example:
○ Top_p 0.9: The model chooses from the top 90% of likely responses, keeping it
balanced.
○ Top_p 0.5: Restricts options further, making responses less varied but more
concise.

8. Tools
● Explanation: Enables the model to use external plugins or APIs for specialized tasks.
● Example:
○ With a web-search tool:
User: &quot;What&#39;s the current weather in Rome?&quot;
Response: &quot;Let me check... The current temperature in Rome is 24°C and
sunny.&quot;
